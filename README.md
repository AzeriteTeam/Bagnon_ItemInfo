This is a simple plugin for the addon [Bagnon](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon) that shows the item level of your equipable gear, bind status of items, a purple eye on uncollected transmog appearances and desaturates and tones down vendor garbage. 

This addon does the same as our three separate plugins [Bagnon ItemLevel](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon-itemlevel), [Bagnon BoE](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon-boe), [Bagnon Garbage](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon-garbage) and [Bagnon Uncollected](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon-uncollected) combined, but without the extra overhead of multiple post updates on every single container button. All is combined into a singule update, and provides all the information through a single addon with no more updates then needed to keep the performance as high as possible. 

Targeted towards users or would-be users of all the three aforementioned addons.
